and has been tested on various GNU/Linux systems using GCC and
Windows Vista and Windows 7 using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010.

Tested OpenCL platforms:
AMD (CPU and GPU)

If you are using uCLbench on other platforms please let us know.


Installation Instructions
=======================================

1) set the
OPENCL_INCLUDE
and
OPENCL_LIBRARY
environment variables to the include / library paths of your OpenCL
platform (if not already in the compiler's search paths). The include 
path should contain CL/opencl.h and the associated files, the library
path should contain libOpenCL.so or OpenCL.dll.

2) run cmake
3) run make (or open the generated project file and compile when using a different generator)

The binaries and required kernel files are stored in [BUILD_DIR]/bin


Examples
=======================================

The following performs an out-of-source build starting from the directory this file is in:
mkdir build
cd build
export OPENCL_ROOT=~/AMD-APP-SDK-v2.4-lnx64/ 
export OPENCL_LIBRARY=~/AMD-APP-SDK-v2.4-lnx64/lib/x86_64/ 
cmake ..

On Windows using Visual Studio 10:
set OPENCL_INCLUDE=C:\Program Files (x86)\AMD APP\include
set OPENCL_LIBRARY=C:\Program Files (x86)\AMD APP\lib\x86
cmake -G "Visual Studio 10" ..
